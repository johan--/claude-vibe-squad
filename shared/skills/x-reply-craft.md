# X Reply Craft

Turn a reply or quote post into a conversation that earns attention, replies, and profile
visits. Every good reply bounces off the parent post's exact claim. It never reads like an
advertisement dropped into someone else's thread.

Pick the mode from what the post is and who you are. A brand account speaking in its own
market defaults to **Mode 0**. Anything else is a conversational reply, **Modes 1-6**.

## Step 1: Read the post

Before writing a word, name two things:

1. **The load-bearing claim.** The single sentence or clause the post rests on. You will echo
   or paraphrase their actual words in your first line.
2. **The stance.** Announcement, opinion, question, complaint, or win. The stance picks the mode.

## Mode 0: Thesis -> Gap -> Our Fix (default for a brand reply or quote in our market)

Use this whenever we reply to or quote a post that sits squarely in the market we build for.
It is the default, not a fallback. Four short lines, in order:

1. **Their thesis, paraphrased precisely,** in their own terms. No strawman, no inflation.
2. **The gap** — one or two concrete questions their thesis leaves open. Not doubt about their
   vision, but the specific unanswered question a builder in this space asks next.
3. **Our fix** — one named capability mapped to each question, in plain words, with a status
   that is honest about whether it is live today or still being built. The product appears here
   only as the answer to the gap, phrased in the terms the gap set.
4. **A forward close** — one line tying the fix back to the stakes their thesis raised.

Here the product is not a pitch bolted on. It *is* the fix, but only as the answer to a
question their own thesis opened. If a capability answers no gap you named, cut it.

### Worked example (Mode 0, fictional product)

> The post predicts that autonomous agents will handle routine deployment work.
> Two questions remain: does the change pass its checks, and can the team recover if
> deployment fails?
> We are building Example Deploy to cover both: Check reports failing tests, and Restore prepares
> a rollback plan before release. Both capabilities are still in development.
> Autonomous deployment needs a verified change and a recovery path before it goes live.

Line 1 paraphrases the thesis in their terms. Line 2 names two concrete gaps. Line 3 maps one
capability to each gap and stays honest that the product is still being built. Line 4 closes
forward on the stakes they raised.

## Modes 1-6: conversational replies

Use these when the post is not ours to answer with a fix, and the right move is to be a good
participant in the thread. In every one of these, a product mention appears at most once, and
usually not at all. The profile does the selling.

### Mode 1: Agree and add
Validate their exact point, then add the concrete detail or next step they left implicit.

### Mode 2: Congratulate with proof of reading
Name one specific technical or operational detail from the post, then say why that choice is
harder or better than the usual path.

### Mode 3: Ask one sharp question
Isolate an unaddressed edge case or a hidden assumption and ask it plainly, without leading.

### Mode 4: Add nuance
Concede the rule holds in the common case, then name the one boundary condition where it flips.

### Mode 5: Push back respectfully
Restate their premise, then give a dated counter-example or an observed constraint that
contradicts it. Evidence, not opinion.

### Mode 6: Share first-hand experience
Say what happened when you built or tested the exact thing they describe. Name the project only
as the reason you hit the result.

## The product-mention rule (mode-dependent)

- **Mode 0:** the product IS the fix, but only as the answer to the gap, in the terms the gap
  set. Never more than the gap asked for.
- **Modes 1-6:** at most one brief clause, and usually none. If the only thing you can say is a
  pitch, do not reply.

## Rules for every reply

1. **Bounce off their words.** Quote, name, or paraphrase their specific clause in your first
   sentence. Never open with a greeting or your product name.
2. **One idea per sentence.** A reply is not a whitepaper.
3. **No links, no hashtags.** Both read as broadcast and get suppressed.
4. **Shorter wins.** Cut filler, corporate qualifiers, and throat-clearing.

## Pre-post gate tests

Every candidate reply must pass all of these before it ships:

1. **Any-post test.** Could this reply sit unchanged under a different post on the same topic?
   If yes, rewrite. For Mode 0, apply it line by line: the thesis paraphrase, each gap question,
   and each mapped capability must each be specific to *this* post.
2. **Mapping test (Mode 0).** Each named capability answers a gap you actually stated, and the
   live-or-building status is honest. Drop any capability that answers nothing.
3. **Read-aloud test.** Read it out loud. One clean idea per sentence, no repeated words, a
   stranger grasps it immediately.
4. **Accuracy test.** Every stated fact matches verified documentation; any quoted word or verb
   matches the source text.

## When NOT to reply

- You have no genuine insight, gap, lived experience, or sharp question to add.
- The thread is already crowded and your angle adds no distinct signal.
- The only thing you can say is a pitch, in a mode where the pitch is not the answer to a gap.

If the topic matters to your audience, write your own post or quote post instead of a weak reply.

## Output format

Offer two or three distinct options:

- **Option N (Mode name):** the draft text
- **Character count:** N / 280
- **Gate tests:** Any-post | Mapping (Mode 0) | Read-aloud | Accuracy, each Pass or Fail
